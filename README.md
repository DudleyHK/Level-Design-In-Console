A console application consisting of two techniques for level automation. Console applications are a quick easy way to see how the fundemetal ideas will work. These are a part of my Final Year Disseration project, [Investigating Automated Level Design](https://github.com/DudleyHK/Investigating-Automated-Level-Design).

#### Sentence Generator
Use different sentence parts to generate sentences where the rule set is English sentence structure. The idea here was a) to get use to automated level design and b) that each word can be replaced with more complex data types.
